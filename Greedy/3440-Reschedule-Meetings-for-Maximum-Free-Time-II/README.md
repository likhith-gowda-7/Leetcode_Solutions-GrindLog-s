## 📝 Problem Description

You are given an integer `eventTime` denoting the duration of an event. You are also given two integer arrays `startTime` and `endTime`, each of length `n`.

These represent the start and end times of `n` **non-overlapping** meetings that occur during the event between time `t = 0` and time `t = eventTime`, where the `i^th` meeting occurs during the time `[startTime[i], endTime[i]].`

You can reschedule **at most **one meeting by moving its start time while maintaining the **same duration**, such that the meetings remain non-overlapping, to **maximize** the **longest** *continuous period of free time* during the event.

Return the **maximum** amount of free time possible after rearranging the meetings.

**Note** that the meetings can **not** be rescheduled to a time outside the event and they should remain non-overlapping.

**Note:** *In this version*, it is **valid** for the relative ordering of the meetings to change after rescheduling one meeting.

 

Example 1:**

**Input:** eventTime = 5, startTime = [1,3], endTime = [2,5]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/12/22/example0_rescheduled.png)

Reschedule the meeting at `[1, 2]` to `[2, 3]`, leaving no meetings during the time `[0, 2]`.

Example 2:**

**Input:** eventTime = 10, startTime = [0,7,9], endTime = [1,8,10]

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/12/22/rescheduled_example0.png)

Reschedule the meeting at `[0, 1]` to `[8, 9]`, leaving no meetings during the time `[0, 7]`.

Example 3:**

**Input:** eventTime = 10, startTime = [0,3,7,9], endTime = [1,4,8,10]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/01/28/image3.png)**

Reschedule the meeting at `[3, 4]` to `[8, 9]`, leaving no meetings during the time `[1, 7]`.

Example 4:**

**Input:** eventTime = 5, startTime = [0,1,2,3,4], endTime = [1,2,3,4,5]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

There is no time during the event not occupied by meetings.

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= eventTime <= 10^9`

	- `n == startTime.length == endTime.length`

	- `2 <= n <= 10^5`

	- `0 <= startTime[i] < endTime[i] <= eventTime`

	- `endTime[i] <= startTime[i + 1]` where `i` lies in the range `[0, n - 2]`.
