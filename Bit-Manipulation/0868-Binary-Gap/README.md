## 📝 Problem Description

Given a positive integer `n`, find and return *the **longest distance** between any two **adjacent** *`1`*'s in the binary representation of *`n`*. If there are no two adjacent *`1`*'s, return *`0`*.*

Two `1`'s are **adjacent** if there are only `0`'s separating them (possibly no `0`'s). The **distance** between two `1`'s is the absolute difference between their bit positions. For example, the two `1`'s in `"1001"` have a distance of 3.

 

Example 1:**

```

**Input:** n = 22
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 22 in binary is "10110".
The first adjacent pair of 1's is "10110" with a distance of 2.
The second adjacent pair of 1's is "10110" with a distance of 1.
The answer is the largest of these two distances, which is 2.
Note that "10110" is not a valid pair since there is a 1 separating the two 1's underlined.

```

Example 2:**

```

**Input:** n = 8
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** 8 in binary is "1000".
There are not any adjacent pairs of 1's in the binary representation of 8, so we return 0.

```

Example 3:**

```

**Input:** n = 5
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** 5 in binary is "101".

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 10^9`
