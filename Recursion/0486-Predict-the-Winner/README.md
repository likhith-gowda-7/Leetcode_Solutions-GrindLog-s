## 📝 Problem Description

You are given an integer array `nums`. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.

Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of `0`. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., `nums[0]` or `nums[nums.length - 1]`) which reduces the size of the array by `1`. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.

Return `true` if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return `true`. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.

 

Example 1:**

```

**Input:** nums = [1,5,2]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2. 
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2). 
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5. 
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.

```

Example 2:**

```

**Input:** nums = [1,5,233,7]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 has to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.
Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 20`

	- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^7`

## 🧠 Solution Explanation

**Intuition**
The solution uses dynamic programming and recursion to simulate the game between two players. The key insight is that the optimal strategy for the players is to maximize their difference in scores at each turn. By calculating the maximum difference in scores, we can determine if Player 1 can win the game.

**Approach**
1. Check if the length of the array is even. If it is, return `True` immediately, as Player 1 can always mirror Player 2's moves and win.
2. Define a recursive function `maxDiff` that calculates the maximum difference in scores between two players at a given range of the array.
3. Base case: if the range has only one element, return that element.
4. Recursive case: calculate the maximum difference by considering two possibilities:
	* Player 1 chooses the first element of the range, and the maximum difference is `A[i] - maxDiff(i + 1, j)`.
	* Player 1 chooses the last element of the range, and the maximum difference is `A[j] - maxDiff(i, j - 1)`.
	* Return the maximum of these two possibilities.
5. Call `maxDiff` with the initial range `[0, n - 1]` and check if the maximum difference is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, return `True`, indicating that Player 1 can win the game.

**Time Complexity**
O(n^2) due to the recursive function `maxDiff`, where n is the length of the array. However, the use of memoization (via the `@cache` decorator) reduces the actual time complexity to O(n^2 / 2) because each subproblem is solved only once.

**Space Complexity**
O(n^2) due to the recursive call stack and the memoization table.

**Key Insight**
The key insight is that the optimal strategy for the players is to maximize their difference in scores at each turn. By calculating the maximum difference in scores, we can determine if Player 1 can win the game. This is a classic example of a zero-sum game, where the sum of the scores of the two players is always 0.
