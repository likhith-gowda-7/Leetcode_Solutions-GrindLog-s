## 📝 Problem Description

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

 

Example 1:**

```

**Input:** n = 5, bad = 4
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:**
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.

```

Example 2:**

```

**Input:** n = 1, bad = 1
**Output:** 1

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= bad <= n <= 2^31 - 1`
