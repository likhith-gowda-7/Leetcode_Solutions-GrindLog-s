## 📝 Problem Description

You are given an integer `num`. You know that Bob will sneakily **remap** one of the `10` possible digits (`0` to `9`) to another digit.

Return *the difference between the maximum and minimum values Bob can make by remapping **exactly** **one** digit in *`num`.

**Notes:**

	- When Bob remaps a digit d1 to another digit d2, Bob replaces all occurrences of `d1` in `num` with `d2`.

	- Bob can remap a digit to itself, in which case `num` does not change.

	- Bob can remap different digits for obtaining minimum and maximum values respectively.

	- The resulting number after remapping can contain leading zeroes.

 

**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** num = 11891
**Output:** 99009
**Explanation:** 
To achieve the maximum value, Bob can remap the digit 1 to the digit 9 to yield 99899.
To achieve the minimum value, Bob can remap the digit 1 to the digit 0, yielding 890.
The difference between these two numbers is 99009.

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** num = 90
**Output:** 99
**Explanation:**
The maximum value that can be returned by the function is 99 (if 0 is replaced by 9) and the minimum value that can be returned by the function is 0 (if 9 is replaced by 0).
Thus, we return 99.
```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= num <= 10^8`
