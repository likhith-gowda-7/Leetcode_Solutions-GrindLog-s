## 📝 Problem Description

You are given the `root` node of a binary search tree (BST) and a `value` to insert into the tree. Return *the root node of the BST after the insertion*. It is **guaranteed** that the new value does not exist in the original BST.

**Notice** that there may exist multiple valid ways for the insertion, as long as the tree remains a BST after insertion. You can return **any of them**.

 

Example 1:**

```

**Input:** root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
**Output:** [4,2,7,1,3,5]
**Explanation:** Another accepted tree is:

```

Example 2:**

```

**Input:** root = [40,20,60,10,30,50,70], val = 25
**Output:** [40,20,60,10,30,50,70,null,null,25]

```

Example 3:**

```

**Input:** root = [4,2,7,1,3,null,null,null,null,null,null], val = 5
**Output:** [4,2,7,1,3,5]

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range `[0, 10^4]`.

	- `-10^8 <= Node.val <= 10^8`

	- All the values `Node.val` are **unique**.

	- `-10^8 <= val <= 10^8`

	- It's **guaranteed** that `val` does not exist in the original BST.
