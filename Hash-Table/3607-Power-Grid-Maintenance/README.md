## 📝 Problem Description

You are given an integer c` representing c` power stations, each with a unique identifier `id` from 1 to `c` (1‑based indexing).

These stations are interconnected via n` **bidirectional** cables, represented by a 2D array connections`, where each element connections[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates a connection between station `u_i` and station `v_i`. Stations that are directly or indirectly connected form a **power grid**.

Initially, **all** stations are online (operational).

You are also given a 2D array queries`, where each query is one of the following *two* types:

	
	[1, x]`: A maintenance check is requested for station x`. If station `x` is online, it resolves the check by itself. If station `x` is offline, the check is resolved by the operational station with the smallest `id` in the same **power grid** as `x`. If **no** **operational** station *exists* in that grid, return -1.

	

	
	[2, x]`: Station x` goes offline (i.e., it becomes non-operational).

	

Return an array of integers representing the results of each query of type [1, x]` in the **order** they appear.

**Note:** The power grid preserves its structure; an offline (non‑operational) node remains part of its grid and taking it offline does not alter connectivity.

 

Example 1:**

**Input:** c = 5, connections = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]], queries = [[1,3],[2,1],[1,1],[2,2],[1,2]]

**Output:** [3,2,3]

**Explanation:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2025/04/15/powergrid.jpg)

	Initially, all stations `{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` are online and form a single power grid.

	Query `[1,3]`: Station 3 is online, so the maintenance check is resolved by station 3.

	Query `[2,1]`: Station 1 goes offline. The remaining online stations are `{2, 3, 4, 5}`.

	Query `[1,1]`: Station 1 is offline, so the check is resolved by the operational station with the smallest `id` among `{2, 3, 4, 5}`, which is station 2.

	Query `[2,2]`: Station 2 goes offline. The remaining online stations are `{3, 4, 5}`.

	Query `[1,2]`: Station 2 is offline, so the check is resolved by the operational station with the smallest `id` among `{3, 4, 5}`, which is station 3.

Example 2:**

**Input:** c = 3, connections = [], queries = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,1]]

**Output:** [1,-1]

**Explanation:**

	There are no connections, so each station is its own isolated grid.

	Query `[1,1]`: Station 1 is online in its isolated grid, so the maintenance check is resolved by station 1.

	Query `[2,1]`: Station 1 goes offline.

	Query `[1,1]`: Station 1 is offline and there are no other stations in its grid, so the result is -1.

 

**Constraints:**

	`1 <= c <= 10^5`

	`0 <= n == connections.length <= min(10^5, c * (c - 1) / 2)`

	`connections[i].length == 2`

	`1 <= u_i, v_i <= c`

	`u_i != v_i`

	`1 <= queries.length <= 2 * 10^5`

	`queries[i].length == 2`

	`queries[i][0]` is either 1 or 2.

	`1 <= queries[i][1] <= c`
