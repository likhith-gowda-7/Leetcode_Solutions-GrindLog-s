## 📝 Problem Description

You are given a stream of `n` videos, each represented by a **distinct** number from `1` to `n` that you need to "upload" to a server. You need to implement a data structure that calculates the length of the **longest uploaded prefix** at various points in the upload process.

We consider `i` to be an uploaded prefix if all videos in the range `1` to `i` (**inclusive**) have been uploaded to the server. The longest uploaded prefix is the **maximum **value of `i` that satisfies this definition.

Implement the `LUPrefix `class:

	- `LUPrefix(int n)` Initializes the object for a stream of `n` videos.

	- `void upload(int video)` Uploads `video` to the server.

	- `int longest()` Returns the length of the **longest uploaded prefix** defined above.

 

Example 1:**

```

**Input**
["LUPrefix", "upload", "longest", "upload", "longest", "upload", "longest"]
[[4], [3], [], [1], [], [2], []]
**Output**
[null, null, 0, null, 1, null, 3]

**Explanation**
LUPrefix server = new LUPrefix(4);   // Initialize a stream of 4 videos.
server.upload(3);                    // Upload video 3.
server.longest();                    // Since video 1 has not been uploaded yet, there is no prefix.
                                     // So, we return 0.
server.upload(1);                    // Upload video 1.
server.longest();                    // The prefix [1] is the longest uploaded prefix, so we return 1.
server.upload(2);                    // Upload video 2.
server.longest();                    // The prefix [1,2,3] is the longest uploaded prefix, so we return 3.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 10^5`

	- `1 <= video <= n`

	- All values of `video` are **distinct**.

	- At most `2 * 10^5` calls **in total** will be made to `upload` and `longest`.

	- At least one call will be made to `longest`.
