## 📝 Problem Description

Given an array `nums`, return `true`* if the array was originally sorted in non-decreasing order, then rotated **some** number of positions (including zero)*. Otherwise, return `false`.

There may be **duplicates** in the original array.

**Note:** An array `A` rotated by `x` positions results in an array `B` of the same length such that `B[i] == A[(i+x) % A.length]` for every valid index `i`.

 

Example 1:**

```

**Input:** nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** [1,2,3,4,5] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 2 positions to begin on the element of value 3: [3,4,5,1,2].

```

Example 2:**

```

**Input:** nums = [2,1,3,4]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There is no sorted array once rotated that can make nums.

```

Example 3:**

```

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** [1,2,3] is the original sorted array.
You can rotate the array by x = 0 positions (i.e. no rotation) to make nums.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`

	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`
