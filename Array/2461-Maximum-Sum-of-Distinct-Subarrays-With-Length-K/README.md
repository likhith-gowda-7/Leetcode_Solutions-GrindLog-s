## 📝 Problem Description

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Find the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays of `nums` that meet the following conditions:

	- The length of the subarray is `k`, and

	- All the elements of the subarray are **distinct**.

Return *the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions**.* If no subarray meets the conditions, return `0`.

*A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.*

 

Example 1:**

```

**Input:** nums = [1,5,4,2,9,9,9], k = 3
**Output:** 15
**Explanation:** The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
- [1,5,4] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 10.
- [5,4,2] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 11.
- [4,2,9] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 15.
- [2,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
- [9,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
We return 15 because it is the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions

```

Example 2:**

```

**Input:** nums = [4,4,4], k = 3
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
- [4,4,4] which does not meet the requirements because the element 4 is repeated.
We return 0 because no subarrays meet the conditions.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^5`

	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
