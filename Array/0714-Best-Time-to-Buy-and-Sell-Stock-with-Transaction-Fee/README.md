## 📝 Problem Description

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i^th` day, and an integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

**Note:**

	- You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

	- The transaction fee is only charged once for each stock purchase and sale.

 

Example 1:**

```

**Input:** prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** The maximum profit can be achieved by:
- Buying at prices[0] = 1
- Selling at prices[3] = 8
- Buying at prices[4] = 4
- Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.

```

Example 2:**

```

**Input:** prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
**Output:** 6

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= prices.length <= 5 * 10^4`

	- `1 <= prices[i] < 5 * 10^4`

	- `0 <= fee < 5 * 10^4`
