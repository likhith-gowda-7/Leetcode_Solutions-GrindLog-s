## 📝 Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, return *an array* `answer` *such that* `answer[i]` *is equal to the product of all the elements of* `nums` *except* `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and without using the division operation.

 

Example 1:**

```
**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4]
**Output:** [24,12,8,6]

```
Example 2:**

```
**Input:** nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
**Output:** [0,0,9,0,0]

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`

	- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`

	- The input is generated such that `answer[i]` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

 

**Follow up:** Can you solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity? (The output array **does not** count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)
