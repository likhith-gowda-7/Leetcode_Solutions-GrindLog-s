## 📝 Problem Description

You are given an `m x n` `grid`. Each cell of `grid` represents a street. The street of `grid[i][j]` can be:

	- `1` which means a street connecting the left cell and the right cell.

	- `2` which means a street connecting the upper cell and the lower cell.

	- `3` which means a street connecting the left cell and the lower cell.

	- `4` which means a street connecting the right cell and the lower cell.

	- `5` which means a street connecting the left cell and the upper cell.

	- `6` which means a street connecting the right cell and the upper cell.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/03/05/main.png)
You will initially start at the street of the upper-left cell `(0, 0)`. A valid path in the grid is a path that starts from the upper left cell `(0, 0)` and ends at the bottom-right cell `(m - 1, n - 1)`. **The path should only follow the streets**.

**Notice** that you are **not allowed** to change any street.

Return `true`* if there is a valid path in the grid or *`false`* otherwise*.

 

Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/03/05/e1.png)
```

**Input:** grid = [[2,4,3],[6,5,2]]
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** As shown you can start at cell (0, 0) and visit all the cells of the grid to reach (m - 1, n - 1).

```

Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/03/05/e2.png)
```

**Input:** grid = [[1,2,1],[1,2,1]]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** As shown you the street at cell (0, 0) is not connected with any street of any other cell and you will get stuck at cell (0, 0)

```

Example 3:**

```

**Input:** grid = [[1,1,2]]
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** You will get stuck at cell (0, 1) and you cannot reach cell (0, 2).

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `m == grid.length`

	- `n == grid[i].length`

	- `1 <= m, n <= 300`

	- `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 6`
