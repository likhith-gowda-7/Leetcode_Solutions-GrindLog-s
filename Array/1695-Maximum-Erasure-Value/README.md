## 📝 Problem Description

You are given an array of positive integers `nums` and want to erase a subarray containing **unique elements**. The **score** you get by erasing the subarray is equal to the **sum** of its elements.

Return *the **maximum score** you can get by erasing **exactly one** subarray.*

An array `b` is called to be a subarray of `a` if it forms a contiguous subsequence of `a`, that is, if it is equal to `a[l],a[l+1],...,a[r]` for some `(l,r)`.

 

Example 1:**

```

**Input:** nums = [4,2,4,5,6]
**Output:** 17
**Explanation:** The optimal subarray here is [2,4,5,6].

```

Example 2:**

```

**Input:** nums = [5,2,1,2,5,2,1,2,5]
**Output:** 8
**Explanation:** The optimal subarray here is [5,2,1] or [1,2,5].

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`

	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
