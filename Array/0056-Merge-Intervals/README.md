## 📝 Problem Description

Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return *an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input*.

 

Example 1:**

```

**Input:** intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
**Output:** [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
**Explanation:** Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

```

Example 2:**

```

**Input:** intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
**Output:** [[1,5]]
**Explanation:** Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

```

Example 3:**

```

**Input:** intervals = [[4,7],[1,4]]
**Output:** [[1,7]]
**Explanation:** Intervals [1,4] and [4,7] are considered overlapping.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`

	- `intervals[i].length == 2`

	- `0 <= start_i <= end_i <= 10^4`
