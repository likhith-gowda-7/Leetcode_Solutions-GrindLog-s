## 📝 Problem Description

A shop is selling candies at a discount. For **every two** candies sold, the shop gives a **third** candy for **free**.

The customer can choose **any** candy to take away for free as long as the cost of the chosen candy is less than or equal to the **minimum** cost of the two candies bought.

	- For example, if there are `4` candies with costs `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`, and the customer buys candies with costs `2` and `3`, they can take the candy with cost `1` for free, but not the candy with cost `4`.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `cost`, where `cost[i]` denotes the cost of the `i^th` candy, return *the **minimum cost** of buying **all** the candies*.

 

Example 1:**

```

**Input:** cost = [1,2,3]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** We buy the candies with costs 2 and 3, and take the candy with cost 1 for free.
The total cost of buying all candies is 2 + 3 = 5. This is the **only** way we can buy the candies.
Note that we cannot buy candies with costs 1 and 3, and then take the candy with cost 2 for free.
The cost of the free candy has to be less than or equal to the minimum cost of the purchased candies.

```

Example 2:**

```

**Input:** cost = [6,5,7,9,2,2]
**Output:** 23
**Explanation:** The way in which we can get the minimum cost is described below:
- Buy candies with costs 9 and 7
- Take the candy with cost 6 for free
- We buy candies with costs 5 and 2
- Take the last remaining candy with cost 2 for free
Hence, the minimum cost to buy all candies is 9 + 7 + 5 + 2 = 23.

```

Example 3:**

```

**Input:** cost = [5,5]
**Output:** 10
**Explanation:** Since there are only 2 candies, we buy both of them. There is not a third candy we can take for free.
Hence, the minimum cost to buy all candies is 5 + 5 = 10.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= cost.length <= 100`

	- `1 <= cost[i] <= 100`
