## 📝 Problem Description

Given two positive integers `n` and `k`, the binary string `S_n` is formed as follows:

	- `S_1 = "0"`

	- `S_i = S_i - 1 + "1" + reverse(invert(S_i - 1))` for `i > 1`

Where `+` denotes the concatenation operation, `reverse(x)` returns the reversed string `x`, and `invert(x)` inverts all the bits in `x` (`0` changes to `1` and `1` changes to `0`).

For example, the first four strings in the above sequence are:

	- `S_1 = "0"`

	- `S_2 = "0**1**1"`

	- `S_3 = "011**1**001"`

	- `S_4 = "0111001**1**0110001"`

Return *the* `k^th` *bit* *in* `S_n`. It is guaranteed that `k` is valid for the given `n`.

 

Example 1:**

```

**Input:** n = 3, k = 1
**Output:** "0"
**Explanation:** S_3 is "**0**111001".
The 1^st bit is "0".

```

Example 2:**

```

**Input:** n = 4, k = 11
**Output:** "1"
**Explanation:** S_4 is "0111001101**1**0001".
The 11^th bit is "1".

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 20`

	- `1 <= k <= 2^n - 1`
