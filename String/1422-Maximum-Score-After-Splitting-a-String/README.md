## 📝 Problem Description

Given a string `s` of zeros and ones, *return the maximum score after splitting the string into two **non-empty** substrings* (i.e. **left** substring and **right** substring).

The score after splitting a string is the number of **zeros** in the **left** substring plus the number of **ones** in the **right** substring.

 

Example 1:**

```

**Input:** s = "011101"
**Output:** 5 
**Explanation:** 
All possible ways of splitting s into two non-empty substrings are:
left = "0" and right = "11101", score = 1 + 4 = 5 
left = "01" and right = "1101", score = 1 + 3 = 4 
left = "011" and right = "101", score = 1 + 2 = 3 
left = "0111" and right = "01", score = 1 + 1 = 2 
left = "01110" and right = "1", score = 2 + 1 = 3

```

Example 2:**

```

**Input:** s = "00111"
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** When left = "00" and right = "111", we get the maximum score = 2 + 3 = 5

```

Example 3:**

```

**Input:** s = "1111"
**Output:** 3

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= s.length <= 500`

	- The string `s` consists of characters `'0'` and `'1'` only.
