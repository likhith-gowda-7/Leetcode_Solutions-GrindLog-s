## 📝 Problem Description

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. A pair of indices `(i, j)` is a **bad pair** if `i < j` and `j - i != nums[j] - nums[i]`.

Return* the total number of **bad pairs** in *`nums`.

 

Example 1:**

```

**Input:** nums = [4,1,3,3]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** The pair (0, 1) is a bad pair since 1 - 0 != 1 - 4.
The pair (0, 2) is a bad pair since 2 - 0 != 3 - 4, 2 != -1.
The pair (0, 3) is a bad pair since 3 - 0 != 3 - 4, 3 != -1.
The pair (1, 2) is a bad pair since 2 - 1 != 3 - 1, 1 != 2.
The pair (2, 3) is a bad pair since 3 - 2 != 3 - 3, 1 != 0.
There are a total of 5 bad pairs, so we return 5.

```

Example 2:**

```

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** There are no bad pairs.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`

	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
