## 📝 Problem Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `targetSum`, return `true` if the tree has a **root-to-leaf** path such that adding up all the values along the path equals `targetSum`.

A **leaf** is a node with no children.

 

Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/18/pathsum1.jpg)
```

**Input:** root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.

```

Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/18/pathsum2.jpg)
```

**Input:** root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** There are two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
(1 --> 2): The sum is 3.
(1 --> 3): The sum is 4.
There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.

```

Example 3:**

```

**Input:** root = [], targetSum = 0
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** Since the tree is empty, there are no root-to-leaf paths.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5000]`.

	- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

	- `-1000 <= targetSum <= 1000`
