## 📝 Problem Description

Given a **binary tree** `root`, return *the maximum sum of all keys of **any** sub-tree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST)*.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

	- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.

	- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.

	- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

 

Example 1:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/30/sample_1_1709.png)

```

**Input:** root = [1,4,3,2,4,2,5,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,6]
**Output:** 20
**Explanation:** Maximum sum in a valid Binary search tree is obtained in root node with key equal to 3.

```

Example 2:**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/30/sample_2_1709.png)

```

**Input:** root = [4,3,null,1,2]
**Output:** 2
**Explanation:** Maximum sum in a valid Binary search tree is obtained in a single root node with key equal to 2.

```

Example 3:**

```

**Input:** root = [-4,-2,-5]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** All values are negatives. Return an empty BST.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 4 * 10^4]`.

	- `-4 * 10^4 <= Node.val <= 4 * 10^4`
