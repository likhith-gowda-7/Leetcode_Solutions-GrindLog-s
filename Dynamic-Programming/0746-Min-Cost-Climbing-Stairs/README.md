## 📝 Problem Description

You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `i^th` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return *the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor*.

 

Example 1:**

```

**Input:** cost = [10,15,20]
**Output:** 15
**Explanation:** You will start at index 1.
- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.
The total cost is 15.

```

Example 2:**

```

**Input:** cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** You will start at index 0.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.
- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.
- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.
The total cost is 6.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= cost.length <= 1000`

	- `0 <= cost[i] <= 999`
